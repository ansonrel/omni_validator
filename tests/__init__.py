# the inclusion of the tests module is not meant to offer best practices for
# testing in general, but rather to support the `find_packages` example in
# setup.py that excludes installing the "tests" package

# TODO: import eventual subscripts with: 
#import pkg.mod1, pkg.mod2
# sp tjat >>> pkg.mod1.foo() works
